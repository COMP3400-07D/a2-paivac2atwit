# Assignment 2

## Introduction

In this assignment, you will practice working with arrays and strings in the C programming language.

To get started, first clone from GitHub. You may need to "close" the existing folder first.

### Build Instructions

To build this project run the `make` command in the terminal. You must run this *every time you change a file*.

### Running Unit Tests

To run the unit tests, run the following command for `array_fill`. For this assignment, each
function has it's own test file:

    ./test_array_fill

### Commit Instructions

After completing `array_fill`, first add the file called `array_fill.c` to staging:

    git add array_fill.c

Then do the actual commit:

    git commit -m 'Completed array_fill'

Do the same after every function/file completed.

When you are ready to submit the assignment, run the following command:

    git push

## Instructions

### array_fill

For this part, you will implement a function that fills the array with numbers,
from `begin` to `end`, in increasing order.

The function definition looks like the following:

    int array_fill(int *array, int array_len, int begin, int end);

Some test cases:

| array_len | begin | end | array (result) | return_value |
| --------- | ----- | --- | -------------- | ------------ |
|      2    |  11   |  12 |   {11, 12}     |         2    |
|      6    |  11   |  14 | {11,12,13,14}  |         4    |
|      2    |  11   |  14 |   {11, 12}     |         2    |
|      0    |  11   |  14 |        N/A     |         0    |

In the third case, the array will contain `{11, 12}` (because that's what can fit) and the return
value should be the number of elements filled (so with 11, 12, return 2).

### valid_password

**NOTE**: You may use functions from the `ctype.h` header, but not from the `string.h` header. Some
functions that may be useful are those like `isupper` or `islower`.

Originally from [WC '17 Contest 3 J3] (https://dmoj.ca/problem/wc17c3j3).

You'd like to register an account on an extremely entertaining website. You've already selected a username, but it seems
that the requirements for choosing a password are quite strict, in order to completely protect your account from being
hacked into. The password must be a string between 6 and 10 characters long (inclusive), such that every character is
either a lowercase letter (a … z), uppercase letter (A … Z), or digit (0 … 9). Furthermore, it must contain at least
two lowercase letters and at least two uppercase letters.

Your task is to complete the function `valid_password`. The function takes in a password as a string, and returns `true`
if the string is valid, `false` if not.

Some test cases:

| password | return_value |
| -------- | ------------ |
|   abc    |      false   |
|   aBcdeF |      true    |

### string_fill

**NOTE**: You may use functions from the `ctype.h` header, but not from the `string.h` header.

For this part, you will work on a function that fills a string with content. You
are given a char array that you are to fill in (this is called a *destination
buffer*). You are also given the capacity of the destination buffer (also known
as the size).

You task is to fill this array with chars to make it a proper string. For
example, given an array of 9 characters and the letter 'R', you should return
"RRRRRRRR". This is **8 (eight)** Rs, not 9, since we need to contend with the
terminator character.

If `dest` is `NULL`, your code should do nothing and just return.

Some test cases:

| dest_cap | c | dest (result) |
| -------- | - | ------------- |
|       2  | S |     "S"       |
|       9  | R |  "RRRRRRRR"   |
|       1  | G |     ""        |

### string_concat

**NOTE**: You may use functions from the `ctype.h` header, but not from the `string.h` header.

For this part, you will work on a function that concatenates two strings.
Concatenation means there are two strings, and the second string is added to the
back of the first string. For example: "AAA" and "BBB" concatenated becomes
"AAABBB".

You will be given a char array that contains a string (and some additional empty
space). This is called `src1` for destination. You are also provided the total
capacity for the array, called `src1_cap`. Note that `src1` is already *partially
filled*, so you need to first find the end of that partial data.

You will also be given a string that will be concatenated to the first string.

The function looks like this. You are passed two strings, `src1` and `src2`.
`src1` contains a string, but *also* has additional space after that. The total
capacity of `src1` is therefore in `src1_cap`.

    void string_concat(char *src1, int src1_cap, const char* src2);

> [!NOTE]
> Because strings are char arrays in C, you *cannot* just do `a + b`.

Some test cases (assuming `src1_cap` is 4):

| src1  | src2 | new src1 (result) |
| ----- | ---- | ----------------- |
| "A"   |  "B" |         "AB"      |
| "AA"  |  "B" |        "AAB"      |
| "AA"  | "BB" |        "AAB"      |

Last example is because `src1` has capacity of 4, but because we need the terminator, we can only
hold up to 3 characters.

### array_create_evens

For this part, you will implement a function that *creates* an array with even numbers, from `begin`
to `end`, in increasing order. The function definition looks like the following:

    int* array_create_evens(int begin, int end);

To create an array, you need to call `malloc` to allocate a dynamic array, then
call `array_fill` on that. Lastly, return this pointer (the testing fraweork is
responsible for freeing this array, so no worries).

If the range is impossible (for example, 3 and 3), then return `NULL`.

Some test cases:

| begin | end | returns |
| ----- | --- | ------- |
|   1   |  4  |   {2,4} |
|   1   |  5  |   {2,4} |
|   3   |  3  |   NULL  |
|   5   |  1  |   NULL  |


> [!NOTE]
> If you get the following error, this means the array *you created* wasn't
> large enough so the tests went out-of-bounds. Make sure you call malloc with
> `sizeof(int) * length`

    =================================================================
    ==9129==ERROR: AddressSanitizer: heap-buffer-overflow

        #1 0x55827f7ca4ad in test_array_create_11_12 test_array_create.c:24

### capitalize

For this part, you will implement a function that takes a string `s` and returns a *new* string that
has all of its lower-case alphabet letters into uppercase, using the `toupper` function. All
other letters should be left alone.

The function definition looks like the following:

    char* capitalize(const char *s);

Note that the function returns a pointer to an character array, so you need to use dynamic memory (aka `malloc`) here to
first create the array before filling it in with uppercase letters, then returning it. I will bre
responsible for freeing the memory, so don't worry!

Also, **make sure** you fully understand the difference between a character array, and a
null-terminated string. What is the length of an array `{'a', 'b', 'c'}`, vs. the length of a string
``abc``? If the size isn't big enough, you may get a buffer overflow like the previous function.
